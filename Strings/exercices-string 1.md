1 . Write a function that takes in a string and returns the first and last characters of the string.
For example, if the input string is "hello", the output should be "ho".

2 . Write a function that takes in a string and returns the first two and last two characters of the string.
For example, if the input string is "hello", the output should be "helo".

3.Write a function that takes in a string and returns the middle character(s) of the string. If the length of the string is even, return the two middle characters.
For example, if the input string is "hello", the output should be "l". If the input string is "helloo", the output should be "lo".

4.Write a function that takes in a string and returns the string with all vowels removed.
For example, if the input string is "hello", the output should be "hll".

5 .Write a function that takes in a string and a delimiter and returns a list of the words in the string split by the delimiter.
For example, if the input string is "hello world" and the delimiter is " ", the output should be ["hello", "world"].

6.Write a function that takes in a string and a character and returns the index of the first occurrence of the character in the string.
For example, if the input string is "hello" and the character is "e", the output should be 1.

7.Write a function that takes in a string and a substring and returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring in the string.
For example, if the input string is "hello world" and the substring is "world", the output should be 6.

8.Write a function that takes in a string and a substring and returns the number of times the substring appears in the string.
For example, if the input string is "hello world" and the substring is "o", the output should be 2.

9.Write a function that takes in a string and returns the string reversed.
For example, if the input string is "hello", the output should be "olleh".

10.Write a function that takes in a string and returns True if the string is a palindrome (reads the same backwards as forwards), and False otherwise.
For example, if the input string is "racecar", the output should be True. If the input string is "hello", the output should be False.
